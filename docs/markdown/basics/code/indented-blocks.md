An indented code block is indented four or more spaces. The contents of the code block are the literal contents of the lines

    if (flag == true)
    {
      console.log("Hello world!)
    }


The contents of a code block are literal text, and do not get parsed as Markdown:

    <a/>
    *hi*

    - one
